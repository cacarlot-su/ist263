    Hello, my name is Christina Carlotto! I am currently undecided in my major in the college of arts and sciences, but my plans are to transfer to iSchool next semester! I am interested in information, management, and technology. I have been hired by a couple of jobs that put my technological skills to test, requiring me to learn new systems in days. I love to be active by going to the gym, for runs and hikes with beautiful views!  I love my family, friends, listening to music and watching movies.
